## feedback

a. The assessment took about 24h
b. For the header and footer, I chose to use static content, as the focus was the site components
c. Building up the carousel elements and getting it to be completely responsive was interesting with all the visual elements. I chose to build them up individually so as to make future animation easier. Implemented some interactions on some elements to illustrate this capability.
d. I highlighted the plugins I would install but did not actually install them.
